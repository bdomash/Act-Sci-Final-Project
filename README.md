# Act-Sci-Final-Project
Final project from my Regression Analysis for Actuaries class, coded in R. The project's focus is analyzing what factors makes countries' citizens happy

The final report is under the file name 'DomashWaltmans_Determinants of Country Happiness .pdf'

The rest of the files are the various Rcode for the tasks and steps along the way, which I will are a bit messy and for the most part are not very robust.

Much of the data wrangling and cleaning are found in 'Data reshaping and column cleaning.R' and 'Step 3.R', whereas the rest where working towards the class deliverables. Not included are the various excel data sources, as there were many files that were far too large to upload.
